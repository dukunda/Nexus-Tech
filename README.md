## 📝 Project Overview
This project is a multi-page website built for **Nexus Tech Society**, an organization dedicated to technological literacy. [cite_start]The core objective was to implement a fully structured website using **pure HTML5**—without any CSS or JavaScript—to demonstrate mastery of web semantics and structure[cite: 4, 5, 8].

## 🛠️ HTML Elements Checklist Implementation
[cite_start]I have ensured that **all** required core HTML elements are used across the site[cite: 20]:

* [cite_start]**Semantic Layout:** Used `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, and `<footer>`[cite: 22].
* [cite_start]**Advanced Forms:** Implemented `<fieldset>`, `<legend>`, `<datalist>`, `<optgroup>`, and all input types including `date`, `tel`, and `range`[cite: 28, 53].
* [cite_start]**Media & Data:** Integrated `<iframe>`, `<video>`, `<audio>`, `<progress>`, `<meter>`, `<picture>`, and `<map>` with `<area>`[cite: 28, 32].
* [cite_start]**Technical Text:** Used `<code>`, `<pre>`, `<kbd>`, `<samp>`, and `<var>`[cite: 26].
* [cite_start]**Internationalization:** Included `<bdo>`, `<bdi>`, and `<ruby>` with `<rt>` and `<rp>`.

## 🎨 Design Mockup
The original design for this project was created in **Figma**. [cite_start]The frames correspond to the 6-page structure and focus on logical hierarchy without styling[cite: 61]. The instructor has been invited to the Figma project via the email provided.
